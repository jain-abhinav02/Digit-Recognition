# Digit-Recognition
This repository contains the code to kick start your deep learning journey with the Hello World of Neural Netwoks. The MNIST dataset is a great dataset to get a feel of machine learning without having to worry much about the pre processing. It is ideal to learn about how to create a model, compile the model, train and test the model. Moreover it is readily available as a part of Keras libraries.

## MNIST dataset
This dataset contains a number of images of all digits. 

## Neural Network
I have used a basic Neural Network without CNN layers to understand how well does it perform on image dataset. After trying a number of different combinations of hyper parameters, I have arrived at a conclusion that one cannot extract greater accuracy beyond a reasonable limit using simply ANN. The use of Convolutional Neural network greatly improves the accuracy of the model.

## Things to learn
1. Handling catgorical data
2. Dividing data to train/dev/test sets
3. Constructing a basic Neural Network using Keras Sequential Model
